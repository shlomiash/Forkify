# Forkify
This project was developed as part of "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann. Throughout the course, I gained in-depth knowledge of modern JavaScript, including ES6+, asynchronous programming, API handling, and DOM manipulation. This project showcases the skills I learned, applying best practices and hands-on techniques taught in the course.

Key features include:

JavaScript ES6+ features
Asynchronous programming and API integration
DOM manipulation and event handling
This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive, real-world applications using modern JavaScript technologies.
